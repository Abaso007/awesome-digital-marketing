💎  __awesome-digital-marketing__ is an [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re) list that curates best in class digital marketing blogs, guides, resources, scripts, services, software and more for today's digital marketing professional. This is not a fixed list. The intention is for it to be expanded upon and pruned often.

### Who is this list for?

If you've found this list, there's a great chance that it's meant for you. This list was created as a means to cut through the noise (and hype) that we marketers often face when vetting new resources and services. I use the term "marketers" loosely, as I believe that we should all be striving to market ourselves at the very least, regardless of profession.

### How to use this list

This list is not meant to be read in any particular order, but you can of course do so if you wish. I suggest you :eyes: watch, :star: star, and use your browser's find function (Ctrl+F or ⌘-F) as necessary for best results.

### About the curator

My name is Paul Bradish. I first encountered digital marketing by way of search engine optimization (SEO) after learning HTML in the mid 90's. Years later it would become my career, and I've now been in the industry for over 15 years. I've been around long enough to see numererous influencers, resources, and services come and go. I've notched a few wins and I've made even more mistakes. This puts me in a position where I feel confident to share my findings with the community. A community that has enjoyed a reputation of being very open, sharing, and collaborative since the very beginning.

### Ground rules

1. Personal and contributor recommendations only.
2. Do your due dilligence.
3. Affiliate links are never allowed. 
4. If there is a sponsor, they will be noted as such.
5. Do your due dilligence.
6. When in doubt, I prune it from the list.
7. When in doubt, I leave it off the list. 
8. Do your due dilligence.

### Finally...

I hope this list helps point you in the right direction, but I cannot stress this enough: ___don't take it (or anything you read online) verbatim.___ Use it as a resource only and do your own research. When vetting services and software especially, using an [evaluation matrix](https://www.google.com/search?q=evaluation+matrix) is an effective way verify that you're making the right choice.

If you do find this awesome list useful, please share it with others! ☮️
